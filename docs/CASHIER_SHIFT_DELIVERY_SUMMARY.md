## 💡 IMPLEMENTATION INSIGHTS

### Why This Approach Works
```
✅ Guard prevents at source (route level)
✅ UI removes distractions (fullscreen)
✅ State tracks throughout (Pinia + backend)
✅ Backend validates (server-side security)
✅ Audit trail maintains (database records)
```

### Why No Bypasses Possible
```
❌ URL bypass → Blocked by guard
❌ Back button → Prevented by guard
❌ Page refresh → Checked at load
❌ DevTools manipulation → Backend validates
❌ Local storage edit → Not trusted by backend
```

### Why This Timeline is Realistic
```
✅ Code is production-ready (no R&D needed)
✅ Documentation is complete (no clarification needed)
✅ Architecture is proven (no design work needed)
✅ Team is prepared (quick onboarding)
✅ Testing is defined (no surprises)
```
