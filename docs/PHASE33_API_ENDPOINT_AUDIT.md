# PHASE 33 - API ENDPOINT AUDIT & VERIFICATION

**Date**: January 17, 2026  
**Purpose**: Map all API endpoints used in frontend vs. available in backend

## 🔗 BACKEND ROUTE FILES FOUND

Total backend route files: 129+

Sample routes structure:
- `src/routes/auth.routes.ts`
- `src/routes/addon.routes.ts`
- `src/routes/analytics.routes.ts`
- `src/routes/archive.routes.ts`
- `src/routes/audit-log.routes.ts`

## 🔴 CRITICAL CHECKS NEEDED

### 1. Route Guard Issues
- [ ] Verify `/app` redirect logic
- [ ] Verify role-based access control
- [ ] Verify addon requirement checks
- [ ] Verify permission checks for CASHIER role
- [ ] Verify shift requirement for CASHIER

### 2. Dead Routes (Routing but no API)
- [ ] Check each route for working backend API
- [ ] Identify missing endpoints
- [ ] Mark as "PENDING API" if needed

### 3. Unused Functions
- [ ] Check for unused methods in each component
- [ ] Check for unused computed properties
- [ ] Check for unused watchers
- [ ] Check for unused API calls

### 4. Broken Imports
- [ ] Verify all component imports resolve
- [ ] Check for circular dependencies
- [ ] Verify all API endpoints exist

### 5. Data Leakage Risks
- [ ] Verify tenant_id isolation in all queries
- [ ] Check for data access without proper filters
- [ ] Verify role-based data access
- [ ] Check for information disclosure vulnerabilities
