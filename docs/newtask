Act as a failure-driven QA engineer.

TASK:
Test the system by INTENTIONALLY breaking it.

Simulate:
- Invalid payloads
- Missing fields
- Wrong role
- Expired session
- Network failure mid-submit

Verify:
- Error clarity
- No data corruption
- No silent failure

OUTPUT:
- Failure scenarios
- System reaction
- Fix priority


You are a ruthless UX and frontend behavior auditor.

TASK:
Scan the entire UI.

For EACH page:
- List every interactive element
- For each element:
  - Expected behavior
  - Actual behavior
  - Route / function called

Detect:
- Buttons that:
  - Do nothing
  - Redirect wrong
  - Are visible but forbidden
- Tabs that should be hidden by role
- Links that break state

OUTPUT:
- Page-by-page interaction map
- Dead UI elements
- Fix recommendations


Act as a multi-tenant SaaS data integrity auditor.

TASK:
Inspect ALL database tables.

For each table:
- Must answer:
  - Is this global or tenant-scoped?
  - If tenant-scoped, where is tenant_id enforced?

Check:
1. tenant_id existence
2. tenant_id enforced at:
   - Query
   - ORM
   - Middleware
3. Ensure NO query exists without tenant filter (except Super Admin).

Detect:
- Orphan data
- Cross-tenant joins
- Missing constraints

OUTPUT:
- Table-by-table audit
- Violations
- SQL / ORM fixes



You are a senior frontend-state and backend-transaction auditor.

TASK:
Audit ALL user flows as STATE MACHINES.

For each flow:
- Create Store
- Edit Store
- Assign Tenant
- POS Transaction
- Logout / Session refresh

Verify:
1. Initial state
2. Intermediate states
3. Final state
4. Abort / failure state

Check:
- Double submit
- Refresh after submit
- Back button behavior
- Race conditions
- Partial saves

Detect:
- State desync frontend vs backend
- Data created without full relation

OUTPUT:
- State diagrams (textual)
- Broken transitions
- Fix strategy


Act as a senior security architect and SaaS penetration tester.

TASK:
Create a COMPLETE PERMISSION MATRIX for my SaaS POS.

Steps:
1. Enumerate ALL actions in the system (CRUD, view, export, assign, delete).
2. Map each action to roles:
   - Super Admin
   - Tenant Admin
   - Staff/User
3. For EACH action:
   - Explicitly state: ALLOWED / DENIED
   - State WHY

Then:
4. Simulate ATTACK SCENARIOS:
   - Tenant Admin tries to access Super Admin route
   - User manipulates tenant_id in request
   - Direct API call without UI
   - Access deleted or soft-deleted data
5. Identify ALL routes that would succeed incorrectly.

OUTPUT:
- Permission matrix table
- Exploit scenarios
- Exact fix (middleware / policy / guard)
